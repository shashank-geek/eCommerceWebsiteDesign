# eCommerceWebsiteDesign
Assume you are designing an ecommerce aggregator system that would allow the user to sign in , browse for products and then place order, also subscribe/pre-order for products that are yet to be launched. How would you design such a system using micro services and what would be the various micro services and what database would be used for the system to scale?  Also the system supports login via external systems like Google, Facebook and how would such a functionality be achieved?  The system should be designed in such a way that if new category of products are added then it should be added to add and scale?  Explain the system design in terms of concurrency, availability.  How would  information flow across microservices?
